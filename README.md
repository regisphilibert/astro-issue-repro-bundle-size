# Astro Netlify Repro

GH Issue: https://github.com/withastro/adapters/issues/184

## Versions
Astro 4.5.0
Netlify 5.1.3

## Description
SSR routes systematically returns 404 on Netlify when a rest parameter is used at the root of the pages directory.

```
src/
â”œâ”€ pages/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ [...page].astro (static works)
â”‚  â”œâ”€ persons/[id].astro (ssr 404)
```
âœ…
```
src/
â”œâ”€ pages/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ [page].astro (static works)
â”‚  â”œâ”€ persons/[id].astro (ssr works)
```

This problems appears above @astro/netlify 2.2.0, downgrading to said version fixes the issue. Astro version seems irrelevant.

## Step to reproduce

1. Deploy to Netlify
2. From homepage, navigate to any `/persons[id]` route.
